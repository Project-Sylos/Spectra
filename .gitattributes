# Ignore C and C++ files
# These are the files that are generated by the DuckDB build process
# and are not part of the Sylos codebase
# As a side effect, this will also ignore C and C++ language representation on the github project
# but that's fine as this codebase is mainly Go and powershell anyways. :)
